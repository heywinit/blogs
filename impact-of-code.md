My ability to understand and write code has been one of the most cherished things in my life. It's like that Cole lyric where he talks about rapping as the only thing he can see himself doing. I don't know anything other than the art of code.

> I'm deep in with this rappin'  
> It's all this _man_ know  
> I never didn't nothin' better   
> It's hard to let it go   
> But like a father watching his daughter   
> Walk down the altar with tears in his eyes   
> You gotta let her grow   
> And so I shall

## writing code in notebooks

My journey into the art of code began at age twelve when I stumbled onto [QBASIC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QBasic) in school. Learning to print text felt mind-blowing. That day, I went home, eager to derive QBASIC syntax, and spent a day writing a simple calculator in my notebook. i didn't have a computer yet. I waited a week for the next computer lab lecture. And after that wait, guess what happened? **_A SYNTAX ERROR. BRUH._** Turns out, I couldn't just invent syntax with less than an hour's experience. No worries, I spent that whole lecture scouring QBASIC syntax, and the calculator finally came into being. That marked the start of what many call "this cracked dev's journey."

## law or flaw
After getting my dad's old Lenovo laptop, i3 3rd gen, 4GB DDR3 RAM, and a 1TB HDD (a joke now, but I adored it then!) -- I stumbled upon the art of programming software that could be used unlike my calculators that didn't do shit. My dad built accounting and inventory software with VB and DOTNET, dealing with low-paying clients instead of chasing big CS salaries.

One day, I stumbled upon his Visual Studio 2013 code. Even though I didn't get it all, I knew it was incredibly cool. I pestered him with questions, marking it as one of the last times I asked him for programming help. Soon after, I built a simple login system with hardcoded username and password â€” nothing fancy, but I was ridiculously proud. 

When I showed my dad, his reaction wasn't what I expected. Instead of praise, he said, "You shouldn't really get into this business. I'd rather want you to be a lawyer." I didn't want to be a lawyer, and that's when I started keeping my coding progress to myself.

## the how i'm aware, the what or why i'm not
Once I got used to the laptop, I started looking up things I could make and that is when I realized "oh dang I know this thing called programming exists which givesme the ability to create basically anything that I want and guess what the 13 year old me wanted, GRAND THEFT AUTO. I didn't really have any games to play as dad hated those so any game would get deleted. Creating one felt like a god sent solution to this problem. So I once searched game development on google, checked the image section, saw a mention of autodesk maya and learnt (incorrect but yes) that autodesk maya is a drag and drop game designing software. I WAS 13 OKAY?. So I asked my dad if I could install AUTODESK MAYA in the laptop and he said it wont run on this one. I was disapointed. One day (top #10 moments) I found out about brackeys 

***BRACKEYS I FUCKING LOVE YOU. YOU ARE THE BEST GAME DEV CREATOR EVER***. 

I installed Unity. From that point on, my coding 'education' shifted dramatically. I started following (copying step-by-step) Brackeys' tutorial series with an almost religious fervor. I didn't know shit about C# (the underlying language) but I sure knew how to write enough of it to get a basic game working.

It wasn't like I'd memorized specific lines. Instead, I developed this weird, intuitive understanding: I knew that this sequence of characters would make that thing happen on screen. I just didn't understand why it happened or what those specific commands were fundamentally called or doing. It was a bizarre form of pattern recognition, a functional illiteracy that somehow still produced results.
