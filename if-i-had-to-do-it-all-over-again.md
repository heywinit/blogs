My ability to understand and write code has been one of the most cherished things in my life. It's like that Cole lyric where he talks about rapping as the only thing he can see himself doing. I don't know anything other than the art of code.

> I'm deep in with this rappin'  
> It's all a n**ga know  
> I never didn't nothin' better   
> It's hard to let it go   
> But like a father watching his daughter   
> Walk down the altar with tears in his eyes   
> You gotta let her grow   
> And so I shall

## writing code in notebooks

The way I stumbled onto the concept of writing specific characters in order to see some specific pixels move in a specific order was when I learnt about [QBASIC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QBasic) in my school curriculum. I learnt how to write code to print some text and that felt absolutely mindblowing to me. That day I went home, tried derivating QBASIC syntax and writing a simple calculator in my notebook. I didn't have a computer yet. I spent a day writing it and waited a week for the next computer lab lecture (I wish they had more of these). And after that wait, guess what happened? _A SYNTAX ERROR. BRUH._ Apparently I couldn't just come up with my own syntax for a language I had less than an hour of experience with. But no worries, I spent that whole lecture trying to scour through as much QBASIC syntax as I could and finally the calculator came into being. That marked the start of what a lot of people I know today call _this cracked dev_'s journey
