My ability to understand and write code has been one of the most cherished things in my life. It's like that Cole lyric where he talks about rapping as the only thing he can see himself doing. I don't know anything other than the art of code.

> I'm deep in with this rappin'  
> It's all a n**ga know  
> I never didn't nothin' better   
> It's hard to let it go   
> But like a father watching his daughter   
> Walk down the altar with tears in his eyes   
> You gotta let her grow   
> And so I shall

## writing code in notebooks

My journey into the art of code began at twelve when I stumbled onto [QBASIC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QBasic) in school. Learning to print text felt mind-blowing. That day, I went home, eager to derive QBASIC syntax, and spent a day writing a simple calculator in my notebook. i didn't have a computer yet. I waited a week for the next computer lab lecture. And after that wait, guess what happened? **_A SYNTAX ERROR. BRUH._** Turns out, I couldn't just invent syntax with less than an hour's experience. No worries, I spent that whole lecture scouring QBASIC syntax, and the calculator finally came into being. That marked the start of what many call "this cracked dev's journey."
